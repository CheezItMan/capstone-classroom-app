# Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: A list outlining the major things that you want to focus on learning in this project.

1. __Problem Statement__: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve. Re-use the problem statement from the concept write-up or update if you've made adjustments.

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
    - your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions)
    - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
    - differentiation: what makes your idea/product different

1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?

1. __Trello Board__:
    - Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board

1. __Technology selections__:
    - Front-end
    - Back-end
    - Infrastructure - Deployment or Code

1. __Wireframes__:

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
